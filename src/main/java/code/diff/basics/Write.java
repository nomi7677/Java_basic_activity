        // Problem 3: Area and Perimeter
        // Write a program that displays the area and perimeter of a rectangle
        // that has a width of 8.3 and a height of 4.1


        // Problem 4: Mph
        // A runner took 58 minutes and 20 seconds to run 12 kilometers. Calculate
        // how fast there were running in mph

        // Problem 7: Double or Nothing
        // Create a variable and assign it an integer value. Update the variable to have
        // twice its original value.
        // Ex: If the variable starts at 6, it's value after the doubling should be 12


        // Problem 8: Counting up
        // Create a variable and assign it a value of 0. Increment its value 5 times. The
        // variable should have a value of 5 at the end of the program


        // Problem 9: Counting down
        // Create a variable and assign it a value of 3. Decrement its value 6 times. The
        // variable should have a value of -3 at the end of the program
